To build x32 version just launch build_dxvk_32.bat
No prerequisites are required - everything needed(including stuff like python, all the libraries, meson and other bs)
is already included in the Toolchain folder to automate build process.
To build x64 version.... oh well refer to the original dxvk documentation and god bless your soul
unless you really hate decent UX and dont value your time(linux user)
